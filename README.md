# Install 
Just invite the bot to your server [here](https://discordapp.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=565229640646393895&permissions=0&scope=bot). The bot is currently running on an [Odroid XU4Q](https://www.hardkernel.com/shop/odroid-xu4q-special-price/)</br>
Type !Help (**Case sensitive** not !help or !HeLp or any other modification) to see a list of currently supported commands.</br>
This list changes frequently as many new features coming out. </br>

Currently supported commands:</br>
* !Training: Zeigt aktuelle Trainigszeiten/Show current training days<br/>
* !Training \<value\>: Aktualisiert Trainingszeiten/Update training days Bold or italic style? Check out Discord Markup https://gist.github.com/Almeeida/41a664d8d5f3a8855591c2f1e0e07b19<br/>
e.g. !Training "Trainings: :muscle:\r\n:calendar_spiral:Montag: ab 19:30 (Scrim, Review)\r\n:calendar_spiral:Dienstag: ab 19:30 (Scrim, Review)\r\n:medal:Donnerstag ab 19:30 (Ranked)"  Example uses discord markups and emotes like \: muscle\: for :muscle: and \r\n for a new line.</br>

# OverwatchDiscordBot
Websocket based discord bot in GO with [Overwatch stats API](https://ow-api.com/) integration.<br/>
You can also copy an piece of code written for this project, and use it in your own project without any restrictions.<br/>
Im aware that there is [this](https://github.com/bwmarrin/discordgo) pretty good discord bindings api out, which also supports websocket connections. But i wanted to write my own small layer.<br/>
... More Infos coming soon...<br/>
**Caution!** This is a spare time project to dive deeper into Golang. This is not a professional, high scalable discord bot. 

# More Features? A Bug?
Just write an [Issue](https://github.com/LukasMarckmiller/OverwatchDiscordBot/issues) if you miss a crutial command/functionality or encountered a bug.

# Contribute
If you want to contribute in this project, feel free to do so.
First you need a Discord Bot API Token in order to send requests to the discord api endpoint. Feel free to contact me and i will send you the bot token. It should also be possible using other valid bot tokens to authenticate the websocket session (not tested).
